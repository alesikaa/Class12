OOP( Object oriented programming):
    It's just away of writing code. That follows certain rules or guidelines.
    attributes/properties/fields and methods/function /behaviourism.
Why we should we learn OOP?
    1) It simplifies the software development and
     maintenance ( adding new features changing the existing code).
    2) Code duplication is reduced.
    3) It also helps us represent something from real life with the help of class
    and objects.

Class:
 Is a blues print or a design from which actual real life objects are created. Computer uses a class to check
 what that class can do Scanner scan=new Scanner (System.in); Here Scanner is class. scan is an object of scanner class. With the help of objects we can use the methods
 from a class we can also use properties  from that class.

Object:
   Objects are created from classes, and can use them to call methods and the properties  from those class
Note:
    Inside a class sequence does not matter you can define the  methods first or the properties first.
    But when we are inside a method then sequence matters.
